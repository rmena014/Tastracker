# Richard Mena Tasktracker

Throughout my journey of making this project, I had to go through 2-3 different iterations before finally settling on this one.
At first glance, I thought to myself this project was going to be a piece of cake but by the end I realized this was definitely not the case.
On my first iteration of this project, I was under the impression that the use of fs (filesystem) was optional. As a result, I began to research localStorage. Local storage is simply an object that allows you to save values in the browser. Later on I realized this was an issue
since the project needed data from a json file to be edited, created and deleted. Upon realizing this I immediately began to research rest APIs, CRUD operations and I went through countless sites on express documentation, fetch documentation, and of course w3schools and mdn.
Now that I was aware of all that was required I first began my final iteration by creating my server first. To begin I imported all the packages required which were filesystem and the express framework. I then established my port and moved on to creating the routes. Harold was a big help on this project as he gave the class a brief demonstration on how the server should look. I took what I learned from his lesson and knew that my server was definitely gonna consist of app.get, app.post and app.delete methods. The get method retrieves the information, post method submits data to the server and delete deletes the data. In terms of the fs, I had to utilize the readFile() method in order to read my json data file. After declaring all of my routes, I had to initialize an app.listen() function to start the server and make sure it listens on the correct port.
On my app.js file, I first declared a class named Task. My thought process for this was because a class is a template to create objects. I figured this would be a perfect implementation of this because for the task tracker we are basically creating new objects or "task" and messing with its data. Within this class I had a constructor function that will basically initialize an instance of the class Task. Within the constructor I had this.init() which is referring to a function I implementated later in the file. To keep this brief, after declaring my Task class, I created 5 functions that init(), showTasks(), addtask(), deleteTask(), and toggleDone(). The init function initializes all of my event handlers such as the addTask event, deleteTask event and so on. The showTasks function is a function that actually gets the inputted tasks to show up and append to an unordered list. The addtask function gives functionality to the add button and actually allows users to add tasks. The delete function deletes tasks by fetching the delete method implemented in the server. Last but not least, the toggle done function marks when a task is completed and this is done by fetching the patch method in the server.
